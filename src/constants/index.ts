  "The first exoplanet discovered around a sun-like star was 51 Pegasi b in 1995, which revolutionized our understanding of planetary systems.",
  "Hot Jupiters are gas giants that orbit very close to their stars, completing an orbit in just a few days compared to Jupiter's 12-year orbit.",
  "The Kepler Space Telescope discovered over 2,600 confirmed exoplanets during its mission from 2009 to 2018.",
  "Some exoplanets orbit two stars at once, called circumbinary planets - just like Tatooine in Star Wars!",
